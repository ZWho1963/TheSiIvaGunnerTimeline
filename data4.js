Santa Claus, Smol Nozomi, and Meta Knight take note of the rallies and head to The Voice's tower, where they find the protesters being led by Loud [Friend]. Loud [Friend] breaks open the barricades to the tower, but when Santa, Nozomi, and Meta Knight enter, the floor opens up below them and they fall into a subterranean lab.<br><br>Within it, The Voice is revealed to have been using artificial Christmas Spirit derived from Angry Joe's recovered vial. Files and papers strewn about indicate that the Spirit is being used to clone Figments and also grow The Voice's army. The three then head into another room, where they find a man standing in front of a large vat with a giant creature inside. When Santa tells the man to leave, the man refuses, saying that he plans to use the artificial Christmas Spirit to create his \"wife\". Santa then realizes that the man is JustinRPG, and that the creature in the vat is Reshiram. <br><br>After revealing to them that he is working with The Voice, Justin activates a glass wall to separate himself from the three, but Nozomi breaks through. Justin desperately tries to summon Reshiram, typing commands into a computer. However, as he does so, the power overloads, and The Voice reveals himself through the overhead speakers, disapproving heavily of Justin's actions. Justin pleads with The Voice not to take Reshiram away, and The Voice says he would not be unkind enough to do such a thing. He barricades the entrance and the remaining machinery finally summons Reshiram. However, Reshiram lunges at Justin as The Voice says \"be careful for what you wish for\", and devours him.<br><br>The two fuse together into Ju'Reshoggoth, and the two parties battle, with JustinRPG ultimately being killed. The heroes win a hard-fought pyrrhic victory at the cost of one of both the Smolitzer and Santa's arms. They take an elevator to The Voice's tower.",
